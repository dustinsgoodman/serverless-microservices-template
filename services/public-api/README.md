# Public API Service

This service is intended to be the publicly accessible API for the entire backend application. This service provides a GraphQL API that acts as a middleware to other services stood up by the backend.

If you have any needs for REST specific endpoints, you can configure those here which are helpful for OAuth flows and other callback functionality.
